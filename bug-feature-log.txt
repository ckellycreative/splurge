==================
BUGS

###- New plan savings items don't show up in current month (use sequelize transaction to make sure both promises are met -new cat and new plan item)
###- Need to create plan for each new cat
###- When all categories are deleted from a group, the total row is visible/editable 
###- New category groups don't show up under Plan when there are no categories (first load for new users)
###- Transfer transactions are reading as "income" when being edited in the Transactions Form.
###- Transaction form allows submission without all required fields.
###- "All Account" transaction list is not showing all transactions :( ?? )
###- Plan Overview calculation is wrong





==================
IMPROVE

####- Get rid of "tracking" accounts
#####	- Make investments a category
#####- Make "Savings" into "Cash Reserves"
######- Tidy up Plan overview (start, income, expense, net, investments, reserves, unallocated)
#####- Hide Categories
####Filter categories should include transfers
-Have Plans rollover to next month
	- New "Settings" table in db - "plan_rollover_date"
	- ON load check if plan_rollover_date is in previous month
		- if yes, dupe all plan items and update plan_rollover_date
	- Make previous months' plan items uneditable
	- Make future months editable â€” create new ones

- Hover/click to edit plan details

- Function for reconcilliation balance adjustment (transactions created when the "Your actual bank balance" does not match, that renconcile immediately )
- Unhide categories
-Slim down selectors on getAll queries (not *)
- Check why there's a delay upon first load
	-Add loader to app.js when fetching/resetting token. We're getting a whiote screen upon first load.
- Ability to delete/edit/order Category Groups
- Ability to bulk move/delete categories 
- Collapse Plan items under category groups
