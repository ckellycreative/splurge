==================
BUGS

###- Need to create plan for each new cat
###- When all categories are deleted from a group, the total row is visible/editable 
###- New category groups don't show up under Plan when there are no categories (first load for new users)
###- Transfer transactions are reading as "income" when being edited in the Transactions Form.
- Transfers don;t show up under Cash Account transactions (the receiving account)
- "All Account" transaction list is not showing all transactions :( ?? )
- Plan Overview calculation is wrong





==================
IMPROVE

-Slim down selectors on getAll queries (not *)
-Filter categories should include transfers
- Check why there's a delay upon first load
	-Add loader to app.js when fetching/resetting token. We're getting a whiote screen upon first load.
- Ability to delete/edit/order Category Groups
- Ability to move (bulk) move categories into other groups









==================
